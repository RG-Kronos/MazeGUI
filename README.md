# MazeGUI

This is a Maze GUI application.

It is similar to a simple maze set up. It has a start point, end point, barrier addition/removal option etc.
The program helps to understand the algorithm to find the desired location using breadth first search (BFS).

Number of rows and columns are customisable.

ENJOY !!!
